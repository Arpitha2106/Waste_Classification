# Waste_Classification

**AICTE Virtual Internship project**

**Project title** : Waste Classification using CNN Model. \
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data

**Week wise progress:** 

**Week 1** \
Uploaded, extracted, and organized the dataset for analysis.\
Installed essential libraries, including TensorFlow and OpenCV.\
Preprocessed images by converting them to RGB format and mapping them to labels.\
Visualized the dataset distribution with pie charts.

**Week 2**\
Visualized sample images with labels.\
Built and trained a CNN with three convolutional layers, dropout, and ReLU activation.\
Preprocessed images using ImageDataGenerator with rescaling.\
Trained on 22,564 images and tested on 2,513 images over 10 epochs.
